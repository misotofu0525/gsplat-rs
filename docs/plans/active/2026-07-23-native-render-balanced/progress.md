## Frozen package boundary

Balanced is an all-resident, full-membership research profile. Exact remains
the product default. Balanced is opt-in until B5 qualifies and explicitly
promotes a named endpoint; B1--B3 cannot change a public default or stable API.

The [B0 contract](b0-contract.md) now fixes:

- source/decoded/encoded/resident/addressable equality, unchanged source SH
  degree, full requested/Surface/internal/presented resolution, and the pinned
  `SortedAlpha` count/lifecycle receipts;
- a concrete `gsplat-balanced-image-gate/v1` with per-frame RGBA and
  moving-sequence temporal bounds that a repository validator must enforce
  before B1--B3 retain evidence;
- canonical authored and moving camera modes, real-scene minimums and Tier 1
  endpoint scopes;
- one-variable B1 depth-key, B2 projected-plane and B3 Resident attribute
  experiments, with combination deferred to B4;
- finite per-endpoint Accepted/Rejected/Deferred outcomes. Unclear performance
  Rejects instead of starting an unbounded tuning loop; unavailable external
  evidence Defers only its named scope.

## Candidate status

- Contract authoring: Accepted by independent review and root integration (`083870f`).
- Implementation evidence: none; B0 is a document contract.
- Product behavior/defaults: unchanged.
- Remote publication: forbidden for this slice.
- B0 is **Accepted**. B1--B3 remain separate, not-yet-started experiments.
