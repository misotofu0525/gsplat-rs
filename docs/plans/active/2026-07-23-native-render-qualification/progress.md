## Scope

Package Q begins only after M8. Q0 freezes fair comparator identity, datasets,
camera traces, resolution receipts, timing semantics and endpoint schedule.
It keeps Exact, Balanced and Scalable claims separate and does not use a
browser, simulator, compile-only route or unmatched asset as proof of native
or competitor performance.

The active writer owns only this ledger and [Q0 contract](q0-contract.md). It
may not modify the renderer, benchmark producers, comparator harness, product
defaults, or the Balanced and Scalable packages.

## Candidate checkpoint

- Branch: `codex/q0-qualification-contract`
- Exact baseline: `6d5bd5442dee31cea24906744dfdd1d7492095ae`
- State: Q0 remains Active pending root review and integration.
- Scope: comparator identity/launch, common workload admission, terminal timing,
  endpoint schedule, artifact receipts and finite Accepted/Rejected/Deferred
  outcomes are frozen in [q0-contract.md](q0-contract.md).
- Execution: no native, browser or device product benchmark was run by Q0.
- Next: root reviews this narrow candidate; Q1--Q3 start only from the accepted
  contract and their own declared prerequisites.
