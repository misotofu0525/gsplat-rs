# Native Render Exact Core Progress

> Parent roadmap:
> [Native Render Core Refactor](../../completed/2026-07-23-native-render-core-refactor/task_plan.md)

## Machine task-state registry

<!-- gsplat-program-task-states: begin -->
E0 = Accepted
<!-- gsplat-program-task-states: end -->

## Package status

- Package: E — Exact prepared plans and native execution, still shadowed.
- Active task: none.
- Last completed task: E0 — Exact prepared-plan contract and migration oracle.
- Next eligible task: E1 — transactional `PreparedRuntime`, fail-closed
  `PlanSet`, CPU PostSort fallback and canonical `ProjectedWork`.
- E1 state: eligible but inactive. Root integration and fixed-SHA review of the
  E0 candidate must complete before E1 is activated.
- Dependency: Package A/A9 Accepted.
- Product default: unchanged legacy renderer/session path.
- Parallel writer lanes: none. E0 and E1 are serial shared foundations.
  Disjoint E2/E8 lanes begin only after E1 is integrated. Later E4/NEON and
  E5/AVX2 lanes require E3's platform-leaf interface; a non-CPU E8/E9 lane is
  allowed alongside them only with an exact non-overlap proof. E6/E7 remain
  sequential because both own engine/workspace decisions.
- Source-size rule: no fixed LOC quota, split trigger or completion gate. Module
  boundaries follow responsibility, dependency direction, compatibility,
  testability and maintenance risk. A new mixed-responsibility multi-thousand
  owner requires finite review but does not force an artificial split.
- Performance rule: no fixed FPS or competitor percentage gate. Correctness,
  exactness, fail-closed publication and truthful evidence are hard; measured
  performance determines scoped admission or rejection.

## E0 closeout

- Hypothesis: the existing exact-count proofs can be mapped to one small,
  immutable prepared-plan vocabulary before implementation, preventing E1 and
  later parallel lanes from inventing competing state or controller models.
- Final state: Accepted.
- Ended: 2026-07-24 CST.
- Baseline and exact parent:
  `7848912803f9601fb598dcca07b532e9d9893407`.
- Baseline worktree: clean isolated worktree before the first edit.
- Candidate: one focused documentation commit containing only the three files
  in this package. Its exact SHA is reported in the handoff because a commit
  cannot truthfully contain its own object ID.
- Deliverables:
  - [contract.md](contract.md) freezes `PreparedRuntime`, closed `PlanSet`,
    concrete prepared plans/`PlanId`, `ProjectedWork`, per-plan caches,
    generations, transaction/fallback, single result/evidence ownership and
    writer-lane sequencing;
  - [oracle.md](oracle.md) maps full membership, SH0--SH3, stable full32 ties,
    `S/V/C/D`, camera/resolution, ProjectedQuads/Global, Surface/offscreen and
    ABI/wasm/platform evidence to target owners and E1--E13.
- Scope result: no production Rust/WGSL, public API/ABI, platform wrapper,
  benchmark schema, JSON policy or product default changed.
- Correctness/performance boundary: hard Exact proof is separate from scoped
  performance observation. Historical timings cannot be combined into a
  final conclusion, and no FPS, competitor percentage, 800/890-line or other
  physical LOC target is a task condition.
- Ownership result: CPU PostSort, GPU PostSort and GPU Preproject are complete
  plans selected by one future whole-plan controller. There is no public
  `RenderPlan` trait, boxed pass vector, second controller or platform-host
  strategy policy.
- Verification:
  - PASS exact three-file scope and frozen parent;
  - PASS all local Markdown links in the E package;
  - PASS architecture checker self-tests and real-tree checker;
  - PASS architecture policy JSON parse;
  - PASS `git diff --check`.
- Performance/device work: none, as required for this documentation-only task.
- Known correctness issues at closeout: none in the frozen E0 document scope.
- Integration: root task owns fixed-SHA review and integration; this writer
  does not merge, rebase, cherry-pick or push.
- Next eligible task: E1. Do not activate E1 in this candidate.
